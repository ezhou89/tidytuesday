# Learning Data Science with TidyTuesday Challenges

This is Eugene's repository of the TidyTuesday Project



TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. As this project was borne out of the `R4DS Online Learning Community` and the `R for Data Science` textbook, an emphasis was placed on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, `dplyr`, and other tools in the `tidyverse` ecosystem. However, any code-based methodology is welcome - just please remember to share the code used to generate the results.
